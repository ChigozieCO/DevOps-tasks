# Task

Create a PowerShell script that automates the deployment of a sample web application, including pulling the latest code from GitHub and deploying it to IIS.

# Implementation

For this task I will be using a simple web page I designed, you can find the [application here](), the powershell script will pull the code from [it's repo on github] and deploy it on the IIS we installed in [Task 1](../Task-1-Environment-Setup/ansible/winplay.yml).
