# DevOps Engineer Tasks

This project reflects typical real-world challenges DevOps Engineers encounter in their role, it helps you practice your automation skills, configuration management capabilities, and proficiency in CI/CD practices.

- In [Task 1](./Task-1-Environment-Setup/), you deploy and configure a windows server using Terraform and Ansible.

- In [Task 2](./Task-2-Scripting-and-Automation/), you use a powershell script to automate the deployment of a web application on IIS.

- In [Task 3](./Task-3-Configuration-Management/), you will use another script to automate the installation of applications on your windows server. Essentially, this script does what we used Ansible to do in the first task.

- In [Task 4](./Task-4-CI-CD-Pipeline-Setup/), you set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline that pulls the web application from GitHub and triggers the deployment script upon each commit.
